# **Prelim Group Project 1 (CS 122) 👨‍💻**

This project is a Java application created for CS 122 Computer Programming 2 Prelim Group Project 1. 

It implements a Fraction class and a FractionArithmetic class to perform operations on fractions.

## Group 3 👤
- Barrozo, Sebastian
- Bernal, Mariella Lyshael Angeli
- Caramat, Maria Fides Portia
- Mabalot, Rod Clarenz
- Palitayan, Ezekial Avensis
- Vega, Althea Elise
- Yarisantos, Nicole

## Project Structure 📁

  **Package**: _prog2.prelimgroup3_
  
  **Classes**:
  
  + **Fraction.java**: Defines the Fraction data type with numerator and denominator.
  
  + **FractionArithmetic.java**: Executable program allowing user interaction for fraction operations.

## Usage 🖱️

1. **Import Project**: Import this project into IntelliJ IDEA.
2. **Execute**: Run the FractionArithmetic.java class.
3. **Interact**: Follow the on-screen instructions to enter fraction values and choose operations.
4. **Results**: The program displays the results of operations in both fraction and decimal forms.

## Features 🦾
+ Create fractions with numerators and denominators.
+ Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on fractions.
+ Reduce fractions to lowest terms.
+ Display results in user-friendly fraction and decimal formats.

## Class Descriptions 💾
1. **Fraction**:
   - Represents a fraction with private integer fields for numerator and denominator.
   - Includes constructors to initialize fractions, getters for numerator and denominator, and a toString method for displaying the fraction.
   - Provides utility methods for reducing fractions to their lowest terms and converting them to decimals.
   
1. **FractionArithmetic**:
   - Main class with an executable main method.
   - Prompts the user for input and displays menus for selecting operations.
   - Creates Fraction objects based on user input and utilizes Fraction class methods for calculations.
   - Validates user input and handles potential errors.
## Requirements ✅
+ Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
+ IntelliJ IDEA development environment.
